# AWS Certified Security Specialty (SCS-C02) Notes

Welcome to my AWS SCS notes repository.

Here, I document my progress and hands-on work as I prepare for the **AWS Certified Security Specialty (SCS-C02)** certification.

I am currently following **Adrian Cantrill’s AWS SCS course**, performing practical labs and configurations in real AWS accounts to build strong hands-on skills alongside theoretical knowledge.

## About Me

From the start of my career, I’ve been driven by a commitment to learning and growth. I earned my **AAS in Network Design and Administration by age 18**, started as a **NOC Analyst I**, and was promoted to **NOC Analyst II within three months** due to my initiative, adaptability, and problem-solving skills.

I have hands-on experience in network operations, working with **Cisco, Juniper, and Nokia devices**, and troubleshooting complex **MPLS, DWDM, and fiber optic networks**. I’ve also expanded my expertise into cloud technologies and security, completing comprehensive studies in **AWS architecture and security** to build a strong cloud foundation.

To strengthen my cloud security knowledge, I earned **CompTIA Network+, Security+, and CySA+**, and I am currently pursuing the **AWS Security Specialty (SCS-C02)** and **CCSP certifications**.

I thrive in roles where I can **analyze risks, design secure cloud architectures, and ensure compliance with industry standards**. With cloud security constantly evolving, I am committed to continuous learning to stay ahead of emerging threats. I’m excited to bring my dedication, adaptability, and security mindset to a team where I can develop into a **Cloud Security Engineer**, protecting critical systems and data while expanding my expertise in the field.
