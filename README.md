# AWS Certified Security Specialty (SCS-C02) Notes

Welcome to my AWS SCS notes repository.

This is where I document my progress and hands-on work as I prepare for the **AWS Certified Security Specialty (SCS-C02)** certification.

I am currently following **Adrian Cantrillâ€™s AWS SCS course**, performing practical labs and configurations in real AWS accounts to build not only theoretical knowledge but also solid hands-on experience.

Thank you for visiting my notes repository.

From the start of my career, Iâ€™ve been driven by a commitment to learning and growth. I earned my AAS in Network Design and Administration by age 18, started as a NOC Analyst I, and was promoted to NOC Analyst II within three months due to my initiative, adaptability, and problem-solving skills.

Iâ€™ve built hands-on experience in network operations, working with Cisco, Juniper, and Nokia devices, troubleshooting complex MPLS, DWDM, and fiber optic networks. Iâ€™ve also expanded my expertise into cloud technologies and security, completing comprehensive studies in AWS architecture and security to build a strong cloud foundation without formal exam certification.

To strengthen my cloud security knowledge, I earned CompTIA Network+, Security+, and CySA+, and I am currently pursuing the AWS Security Specialty (SCS-C02) and CCSP certifications.

I thrive in roles where I can analyze risks, design secure cloud architectures, and ensure compliance with industry standards. With cloud security constantly evolving, Iâ€™m committed to continuous learning and growth to stay ahead of emerging threats. Iâ€™m excited to bring my dedication, adaptability, and security mindset to a team where I can develop into a Cloud Security Engineer, contributing to the protection of critical systems and data while expanding my expertise in the field.
